## Installation

Type "npm install" in the console to install the dependancies this application requires (Express, Mongoose, dayjs).

## Usage

In order to run this program, a couple things need to be done. Firstly, the user must have MongoDB installed so that the database and schema are automatically created when the user runs the application. Secondly, type "npm install" in a terminal (making sure its the directory of the repo), which would then install mongoose, dayjs, and express. Thirdly, type "npm start" to run the server. Your localhost:3001/api/ URL will now display objects. Use a program like Insomnia to check out GET, POST, PUT, DELETE http methods.
